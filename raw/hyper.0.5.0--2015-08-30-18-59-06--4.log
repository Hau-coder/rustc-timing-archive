    Auto merge of #27983 - barosl:respect-color, r=nrc
    
    Currently, `early_error` and `early_warn` in `librustc::session` always use `ColorConfig::Auto`. Modify them to follow the color configuration set by the `--color` option.
    
    As colored output is also printed during the early stage, parsing the `--color` option should be done as early as possible. However, there are still some cases when the output needs to be colored before knowing the exact color settings. In these cases, it will be defaulted to `ColorConfig::Auto`, which is the same as before.
    
    Fixes #27879.
