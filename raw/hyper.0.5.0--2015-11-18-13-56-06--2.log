    Auto merge of #29083 - petrochenkov:stability3, r=alexcrichton
    
    What this patch does:
    - Stability annotations are now based on "exported items" supplied by rustc_privacy and not "public items". Exported items are as accessible for external crates as directly public items and should be annotated with stability attributes.
    - Trait impls require annotations now.
    - Reexports require annotations now.
    - Crates themselves didn't require annotations, now they do.
    - Exported macros are annotated now, but these annotations are not used yet.
    - Some useless annotations are detected and result in errors
    - Finally, some small bugs are fixed - deprecation propagates from stable deprecated parents, items in blocks are traversed correctly (fixes https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29034) + some code cleanup.
