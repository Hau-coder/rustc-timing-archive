    Auto merge of #29917 - shssoichiro:doc-sidebar-order, r=alexcrichton
    
    A race condition in Javascript was causing unpredictable ordering
    of the sidebar boxes when loading documentation generated by
    rustdoc, due to the script that adds the Crates box being executed
    asynchronously. Disabling the asynchronous execution and deferring
    this script should ensure that the Crates box always appears last
    in the sidebox (this seemed to be the more common ordering prior
    to this change).
    
    Fixes #29698
