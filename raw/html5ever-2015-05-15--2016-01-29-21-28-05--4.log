    Auto merge of #30448 - alexcrichton:llvmup, r=nikomatsakis
    
    These commits perform a few high-level changes with the goal of enabling i686 MSVC unwinding:
    
    * LLVM is upgraded to pick up the new exception handling instructions and intrinsics for MSVC. This puts us somewhere along the 3.8 branch, but we should still be compatible with LLVM 3.7 for non-MSVC targets.
    * All unwinding for MSVC targets (both 32 and 64-bit) are implemented in terms of this new LLVM support. I would like to also extend this to Windows GNU targets to drop the runtime dependencies we have on MinGW, but I'd like to land this first.
    * Some tests were fixed up for i686 MSVC here and there where necessary. The full test suite should be passing now for that target.
    
    In terms of landing this I plan to have this go through first, then verify that i686 MSVC works, then I'll enable `make check` on the bots for that target instead of just `make` as-is today.
    
    Closes #25869
