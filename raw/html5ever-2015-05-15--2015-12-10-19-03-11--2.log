    Auto merge of #30301 - michaelwoerister:mir-to-metadata2, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This PR makes `Mir` `RustcEncodable` and `RustcDecodable` and stores it in crate metadata for inlinable items.
    
    Some other things in here:
    - `mir::visit::Visitor` is extended to also visit `Literals`, `Spans` and `DefIds`.
    - It also adds `mir::visit::MutVisitor` which allows to mutate the visited `Mir` structure in place.
    - Some numbers on how big MIR is in metadata (total metadata size in bytes):
    
    |                | w/ MIR     | w/o MIR     | Rel. Size |
    |----------------|-----------:|------------:|:---------:|
    | libcore        | 17,695,473 |  14,263,377 |  124%     |
    | liblibc        | 411,440   |  404,382    | 102%      |
    | libcollections |  4,537,975 |   3,526,933 |   129%    |
    | libserialize   |  2,574,769 |   2,060,798 |   125%    |
    | libsyntax      | 15,262,894 |  12,075,574 |  126%     |
    | librustc       | 16,984,537 |  13,692,168 |  124%     |
    
    So, adding MIR to metadata makes it about 25% bigger. It could be worse, considering that it still uses the inefficient RBML encoding. Still, the question is whether we should put MIR emission behind a `-Z` flag.
