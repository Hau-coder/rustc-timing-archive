    Auto merge of #27762 - alexcrichton:fix-libc, r=aturon
    
    The corrected signature of `ioctl` broke some crates on crates.io, and it's not
    currently worth the major version bump of libc, so for now keep the old
    signature around for crates.io builds only with a comment to remove it at a
    future date.
    
    This should allow libc on crates.io to update to the master version in-tree.
    I've verified that this was the only breakage of substance between the version
    libc is currently built with and today's master branch.
