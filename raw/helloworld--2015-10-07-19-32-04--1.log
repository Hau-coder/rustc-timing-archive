    Auto merge of #28811 - alexcrichton:as-ref-ptrs, r=aturon
    
    These common traits were left off originally by accident from these smart
    pointers, and a past attempt (#26008) to add them was later reverted (#26160)
    due to unexpected breakge (#26096) occurring. The specific breakage in worry is
    the meaning of this return value changed:
    
        let a: Box<Option<T>> = ...;
        a.as_ref()
    
    Currently this returns `Option<&T>` but after this change it will return
    `&Option<T>` because the `AsRef::as_ref` method shares the same name as
    `Option::as_ref`. A [crater report][crater] of this change, however, has shown
    that the fallout of this change is quite minimal. These trait implementations
    are "the right impls to add" to these smart pointers and would enable various
    generalizations such as those in #27197.

    This commit is a breaking change for the above reasons mentioned, and the
    mitigation strategies look like any of:
    
        Option::as_ref(&a)
        a.as_ref().as_ref()
        (*a).as_ref()
