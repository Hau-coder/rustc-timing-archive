    Auto merge of #28929 - pnkfelix:expand-legal-cycles-test, r=alexcrichton
    
    Major revision to the dropck_legal_cycles test.
    
    1. Added big comment block explaining the test framework.
    
    2. Added tests exericising Rc and Arc. This was inspired by a comment
       from eefriedman on PR #28861.
    
    3. Made the cycle-detection not issue false-positives on acyclic dags.
    
       Doing this efficiently required revising the framework; instead of
       visiting all children (i.e. doing a traversal), now each test is
       responsible for supplying the path that will act as a witness to
       the cycle.
    
       Luckily for me, all of the pre-existing tests worked with a trivial
       path built from "always tke your first left", but new tests I added
       did require other input paths (i.e., "first turn right, then left".
    
       (The path representation is a bit-string and its branches are
        n-ary, not word phrases and binary branches as you might think
        from the outline above.)
