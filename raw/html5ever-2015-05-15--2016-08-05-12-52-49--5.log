    Auto merge of #35317 - TimNN:internal-deprecated, r=eddyb
    
    Ignore deprecation for items deprecated by the same attribute
    
    Whenever a node would be reported as deprecated:
    
    - check if the parent item is also deprecated
    - if it is and both were deprecated by the same attribute
    - skip the deprecation warning
    
    fixes #35128
    closes #16490
