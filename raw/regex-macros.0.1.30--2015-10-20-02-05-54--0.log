    Auto merge of #29140 - sorear:dst-document-on-sized, r=alexcrichton
    
    This is for discoverability.  If someone wants to know what `?Sized` means, then
    Sized will be the only keyword they can use to search; so even though this is
    technically a language matter, it makes sense to document it where it will be
    looked for.
