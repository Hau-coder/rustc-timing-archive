    Auto merge of #27634 - TimNN:master, r=dotdash
    
    I don't know how this single inline caused the breakage but it seems to be the cause of the issue (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/27619#issuecomment-129420094).
rustc: ./regex-macros.0.1.30
cd regex_macros && cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
