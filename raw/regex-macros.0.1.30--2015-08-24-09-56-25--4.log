    Auto merge of #27857 - Manishearth:improve-fnkind, r=pnkfelix
    
    Since enums are namespaced now, should we also remove the `Fk` prefixes from `FnKind` and remove the reexport? (The reexport must be removed because otherwise it clashes with glob imports containing `ItemFn`). IMO writing `FnKind::Method` is much clearer than `FkMethod`.
