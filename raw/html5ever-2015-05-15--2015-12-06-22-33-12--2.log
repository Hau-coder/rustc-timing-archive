    Auto merge of #30247 - bluss:revert-array-clone, r=alexcrichton
    
    Revert "PR #30130 Implement `Clone` for more arrays"
    
    This reverts commit e22a64e8d8d4da46c74f878ce1c23ad1c88982e8.
    
    This caused a regression such that types like `[[u8; 256]; 4]`
    no longer implemented Clone. This previously worked due to Clone
    for `[T; N]` (N in 0 to 32) being implemented for T: Copy.
    
    Due to fixed size arrays not implementing Clone for sizes above 32,
    the new implementation requiring T: Clone would not allow
    `[[u8; 256]; 4]` to be Clone.
    
    Fixes #30244
    
    Due to changing back, this is technically a [breaking-change],
    albeit for a behavior that existed for a very short time.
