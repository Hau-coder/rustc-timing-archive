    Auto merge of #29153 - arcnmx:thread-spawn, r=alexcrichton
    
    Fixes #29128
    
    Most of the weird lifetime things and `inner` stuff seems like leftover cruft from `thread::scoped`. Should `JoinInner` just be removed/merged with `JoinHandle`?
    
    Also is it okay to remove the `FnBox`? I'm not really sure why there were two allocations there...
