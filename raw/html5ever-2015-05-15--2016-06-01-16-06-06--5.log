    Auto merge of #33814 - lambda:rtabort-use-platform-abort, r=alexcrichton
    
    Open code the __fastfail intrinsic for rtabort! on windows
    
    As described https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn774154.aspx
    
    This is a Windows 8+ mechanism for terminating the process quickly,
    which degrades to either an access violation or bugcheck in older versions.
    
    I'm not sure this is better the the current mechanism of terminating
    with an illegal instruction, but we recently converted unix to
    terminate more correctly with SIGABORT, and this *seems* more correct
    for windows.
