    Auto merge of #31078 - nbaksalyar:illumos, r=alexcrichton
    
    This pull request adds support for [Illumos](http://illumos.org/)-based operating systems: SmartOS, OpenIndiana, and others. For now it's x86-64 only, as I'm not sure if 32-bit installations are widespread. This PR is based on #28589 by @potatosalad, and also closes #21000, #25845, and #25846.
    
    Required changes in libc are already merged: https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/libc/pull/138
    
    Here's a snapshot required to build a stage0 compiler:
    https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/nbaksalyar/rustc-sunos-snapshot.tar.gz
    It passes all checks from `make check`.
    
    There are some changes I'm not quite sure about, e.g. macro usage in `src/libstd/num/f64.rs` and `DirEntry` structure in `src/libstd/sys/unix/fs.rs`, so any comments on how to rewrite it better would be greatly appreciated.
    
    Also, LLVM configure script might need to be patched to build it successfully, or a pre-built libLLVM should be used. Some details can be found here: https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=25409
    
    Thanks!
