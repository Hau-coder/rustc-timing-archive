    Auto merge of #27160 - brson:revdoc, r=huonw
    
    This reverts commit 00130cff99f88e13fec87378bdf476cfea6aa147.
    
    As mentioned in a regression report[1], this caused a notable amount
    of breakage. Because there's a plan to mitigate[2] this type of
    breakage, I'm reverting this until then.
