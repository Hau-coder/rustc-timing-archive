    Auto merge of #29072 - nagisa:place-arrow, r=pnkfelix
    
    This commit generalises parsing of associative operators from left-associative
    only (with some ugly hacks to support right-associative assignment) to properly
    left/right-associative operators.
    
    Parsing is still is not general enough to handle non-associative,
    non-highest-precedence prefix or non-highest-precedence
    postfix operators (e.g. `..` range syntax) and should be made to be.
    
    Lastly, this commit adds support for parsing right-associative `<-` (left arrow)
    operator with precedence higher than assignment as the operator for placement-in
    feature.

    This PR still needs various non-parser changes (e.g. src/grammar and tests) and I’m still working on these; the meat of the PR can already be reviewed, though, I think.
    
    Please review carefully. I made sure that quirks I have discovered so far are preserved (see e.g. https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/29071) and am looking for more corner cases as I continue to work on tests et al, but there may be something I haven’t noticed or accounted for.
    
    EDIT: I’m also not sure I managed to preserve all the semantics with the range operator inside non-trivial expressions since these are a mess at the moment. Crater runs would be nice.
