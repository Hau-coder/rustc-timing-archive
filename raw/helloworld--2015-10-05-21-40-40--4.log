    Auto merge of #28779 - alexcrichton:ffi-isize-usize, r=nrc
    
    This lint warning was originally intended to help against misuse of the old Rust
    `int` and `uint` types in FFI bindings where the Rust `int` was not equal to the
    C `int`. This confusion no longer exists (as Rust's types are now `isize` and
    `usize`), and as a result the need for this lint has become much less over time.
    
    Additionally, starting with [the RFC for libc][rfc] it's likely that `isize` and
    `usize` will be quite common in FFI bindings (e.g. they're the definition of
    `size_t` and `ssize_t` on many platforms).
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1291
    
    This commit disables these lints to instead consider `isize` and `usize` valid
    types to have in FFI signatures.
