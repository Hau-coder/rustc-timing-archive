commit 4005d437653fc09b47cd3176bb65323c52cccd47

    Auto merge of #30245 - Aatch:dynamic-align-dst, r=pnkfelix
    
    Fixes #26403
    
    This adjusts the pointer, if needed, to the correct alignment by using the alignment information in the vtable.
    
    Handling zero might not be necessary, as it shouldn't actually occur. I've left it as it's own commit so it can be removed fairly easily if people don't think it's worth doing. The way it's handled though means that there shouldn't be much impact on performance.
