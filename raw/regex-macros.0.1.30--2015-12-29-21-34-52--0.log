    Auto merge of #29974 - brson:gold, r=alexcrichton
    
    When using `cc` for linking rustc will, if gold is available (by looking for `/usr/bin/ld.gold`), pass `-fuse-ld=gold` to `cc`.
    
    In some scenarios gold links much faster than ld. Servo uses it to considerably speed up linking. gold behaves nearly identically to ld (though I think there are rare corner cases that don't work still). I've run this through crater and everything there continues to link.
    
    To disable, pass `-C disable-gold`.
