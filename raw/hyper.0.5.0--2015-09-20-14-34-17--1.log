    Auto merge of #28429 - wesleywiser:split_up_lints, r=alexcrichton
    
    This breaks out some of the lints defined in `librustc_lint/builtin.rs` into two new modules: `unused` for the `UNUSED_*` lints and `bad_style` for the various style related lints as suggested in #22206. `builtin.rs` could probably get broken up more but this is a start.
