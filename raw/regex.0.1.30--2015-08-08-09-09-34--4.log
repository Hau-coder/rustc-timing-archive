    Auto merge of #27595 - mike-marcacci:patch-1, r=steveklabnik
    
    Keeping integer values and integer references in the "value" columns made the examples quite difficult for me to follow. I've added unicode arrows to references to make them more obvious, without using any characters with actual meaning in the rust language (like `&` or previously `~`).
