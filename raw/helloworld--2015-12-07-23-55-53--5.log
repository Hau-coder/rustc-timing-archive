    Auto merge of #30087 - petrochenkov:indi, r=nrc
    
    I've measured the time/memory consumption before and after - the difference is lost in statistical noise, so it's mostly a code simplification.
    Sizes of `enum`s are not affected.
    
    r? @nrc
    
    I wonder if AST/HIR visitors could run faster if `P`s are systematically removed (except for cases where they control `enum` sizes). Theoretically they should.
    Remaining unnecessary `P`s can't be easily removed because many folders accept `P<X>`s as arguments, but these folders can be converted to accept `X`s instead without loss of efficiency.
    When I have a mood for some mindless refactoring again, I'll probably try to convert the folders, remove remaining `P`s and measure again.
