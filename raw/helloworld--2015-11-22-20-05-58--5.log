    Auto merge of #28907 - SingingTree:rustfmt_libterm, r=nrc
    
    Hey hey,
    
    This is the result of running rustfmt over the libterm module. The first commit reflects the unaltered changes from rustfmt, and the commit message contains some notes on areas where I thought rustfmt had behaved strangely. The second commit attempts to fix the strange areas from the first commit.
    
    Clarification edit: there are still some areas where I think rustfmt has made changes which may merit discussion (one is noted in the comments below). My second commit only undoes the changes that I figured would not warrant discussion (based on my opinion of the style, which is of course subjective).
