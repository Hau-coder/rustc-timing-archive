    Auto merge of #29031 - cristicbz:mtx_inner, r=alexcrichton
    
    The implementation for `into_inner` was a bit more complex than I had hoped for---is there any simpler, less unsafe way of getting around the fact that one can't move out of a `Drop` struct?
    
    See #28968 and rust-lang/rfcs#1269 .
