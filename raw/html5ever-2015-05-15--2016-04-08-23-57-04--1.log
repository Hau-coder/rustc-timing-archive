    rustbuild: Support cross rust-docs packages
    
    Right now if you configure multiple hosts rustbuild will only build
    documentation for the build triple, but we've got all the support necessary to
    build documentation for different architectures as well. This commit
    reinterprets the `target` field of doc `Step` instances to be the target of the
    documentation rather than the target of the rustdoc/tool being run.
    
    This should enable `make dist` to start producing a bunch of `rust-docs`
    packages for all the cross architectures that rustbuild is producing now.
