    Auto merge of #28023 - jmesmon:llvm-path-native-only, r=alexcrichton
    
    This fixes the case where we try to re-build & re-install rust to the
    same prefix (without uninstalling) while using an llvm-root that is the
    same as the prefix.
    
    Without this, builds like that fail with:
    	'error: multiple dylib candidates for `std` found'
    
    See https://github.com/jmesmon/meta-rust/issues/6 for some details.
    
    May also be related to #20342.
