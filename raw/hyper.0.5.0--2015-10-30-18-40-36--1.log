    Auto merge of #29454 - stepancheg:vec-reserve, r=bluss
    
    Before this patch `reserve` function allocated twice as requested
    amount elements (not twice as capacity).  It leaded to unnecessary
    excessive memory usage in scenarios like this:
    
    ```
    let mut v = Vec::new();
    v.push(17);
    v.extend(0..10);
    println!("{}", v.capacity());
    ```
    
    `Vec` allocated 22 elements, while it could allocate just 11.
    
    `reserve` function must have a property of keeping `push` operation
    cost (which calls `reserve`) `O(1)`. To achieve this `reserve` must
    exponentialy grow its capacity when it does reallocation.
    
    There's better strategy to implement `reserve`:
    
    ```
    let new_capacity = max(current_capacity * 2, requested_capacity);
    ```
    
    This strategy still guarantees that capacity grows at `O(1)` with
    `reserve`, and fixes the issue with `extend`.
    
    Patch imlpements this strategy.
