    Auto merge of #30417 - alexcrichton:better-detect-elf-tls, r=alexcrichton
    
    Currently a compiler can be built with the `--disable-elf-tls` option for compatibility with OSX 10.6 which doesn't have ELF TLS. This is unfortunate, however, as a whole new compiler must be generated which can take some time. These commits add a new (feature gated) `cfg(target_thread_local)` annotation set by the compiler which indicates whether `#[thread_local]` is available for use. The compiler now interprets `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` (a standard environment variable) to set this flag on OSX. With this we may want to start compiling our OSX nightlies with `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` set to 10.6 which would allow the compiler out-of-the-box to generate 10.6-compatible binaries.
    
    For now the compiler still by default targets OSX 10.7 by allowing ELF TLS by default (e.g. if `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` isn't set).
