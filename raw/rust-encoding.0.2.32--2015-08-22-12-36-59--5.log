    Auto merge of #27913 - birkenfeld:remove_suffix_len, r=alexcrichton
    
    The methods gave wrong results for TyIs and TyUs, whose suffix len
    should be 5 nowadays.  But since they were only used for parsing,
    and unneeded for that since 606a309d, remove them rather than fixing.
    
    I hope this is ok to do, since all of rustc is considered unstable...
