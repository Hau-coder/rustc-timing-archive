    Auto merge of #28340 - brson:configure, r=alexcrichton
    
    Redirect stdout on the python bogosity detector. This is printing
    pwd to the terminal currently.
    
    Reformat the bogus python/cmake messages so they format correctly.
    echo does not always escape newlines (it doesn't here), and multiline
    strings don't whitespace munch.
