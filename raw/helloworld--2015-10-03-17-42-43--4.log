    Auto merge of #28669 - arielb1:well-formed-methods, r=nikomatsakis
    
    By RFC1214:
    >    Before calling a fn, we check that its argument and return types are WF.
    
    The previous code only checked the trait-ref, which was not enough
    in several cases.
    
    As this is a soundness fix, it is a [breaking-change]. Some new annotations are needed, which I think are because of #18653 and the imperfection of `projection_must_outlive` (that can probably be worked around by moving the wf obligation later).
    
    Fixes #28609
