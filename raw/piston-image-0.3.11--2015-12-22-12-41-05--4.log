    Auto merge of #30353 - alexcrichton:rpath-by-default, r=brson
    
    This commit changes our distribution and in-tree sources to pass the `-C rpath`
    flag by default during compiles. This means that from-source builds, including
    our release channels, will have this option enabled as well. Motivated
    by #29941, this change means that the compiler should be usable as-is on all
    platforms just after extraction or installation. This experience is already true
    on Windows but on Unixes you still need to set up LD_LIBRARY_PATH or the
    equivalent, which can often be unfortunate.
    
    This option was originally turned off by default for Linux distributions who
    tend to take care of these sorts of details themselves, so it is expected that
    all those builds of Rust will want to pass `--disable-rpath` to the configure
    script to preserve that behavior.
    
    Closes #29941
