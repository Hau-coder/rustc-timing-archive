    Auto merge of #28495 - semarie:stdcpp-name, r=alexcrichton
    
    it makes rustc compatible with gcc installation that are using
    `--program-transform-name' configure flag (on OpenBSD for example).
    
    - detects at configure the name of stdc++ library on the system
    
    - use the detected name in llvm makefile (with enable-static-stdcpp),
      and pass it to mklldeps.py
    
    - generate mklldeps.rs using this detected name
    
    note that CFG_STDCPP_NAME is about stdc++ name, not about libc++. If
    using libc++, the default name will be `stdc++', but it won't be used
    when linking.
    
    r? @alexcrichton
    
    I added this support globally instead of just for OpenBSD as it isn't specially related to OpenBSD (except OpenBSD use it for gcc-4.9). And as I would had to change `llvm.mk', having just a default value in `configure' for others platforms won't be very useful.
