    r? @steveklabnik
    
    Currently neither the API docs nor the book clearly explain that out-of-bounds array indexing causes a panic.  Since this is fairly important and seems to surprise a number of new Rust programmers, I think it's worth adding to both places.  (But if you think it would be better to put this info in the API docs only, that's fine too.)
    
    Some specific things I'd like feedback on:
    
    * The new text here talks about panicking, which hasn't been formally introduced at this point in chapter 5 (though it has been mentioned in previous sections too).
    * Similarly the `Vec::get` example uses `Option<T>` which hasn't been fully introduced yet.  Should we leave out this example?
