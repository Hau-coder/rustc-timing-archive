    Auto merge of #30295 - jseyfried:fix_extern_crate_duplicate, r=nrc
    
    Fix a bug allowing an item and an external crate to collide so long as the external crate is declared after the item. For example,
    ```rust
    mod core { pub fn f() {} } // This would be an error if it followed the `extern crate`
    extern crate core; // This declaration is shadowed by the preceding module
    
    fn main() { core::f(); }
    ```
    This is a [breaking-change], but it looks unlikely to cause breakage in practice, and any breakage can be fixed by removing colliding `extern crate` declarations, which are shadowed and hence unused.
