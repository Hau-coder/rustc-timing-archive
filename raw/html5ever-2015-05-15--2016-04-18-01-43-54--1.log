    resolve: Improve performance
    
    This fixes #33061 by speeding up searchs through all traits in scope, a bottleneck in `resolve`.
    
    According to my measurements, this PR improves resolution performance by a factor of 3.4x on `librustc`, which almost completely reverses the 3.75x performance regression reported in #33061.
