    Auto merge of #33103 - ranma42:escape-unicode-last, r=alexcrichton
    
    Implement `last` for `EscapeUnicode`
    
    The implementation is quite trivial as the last character is always `'{'`.
    As a side-effect it also improves the implementation of `last` for `EscapeUnicode`.
    
    Part of #24214, split from #31049.
    
    Maybe this (and the other changes that I will split from #31049) should wait for a test like `ed_iterator_specializations` to be added. Would it be sufficient to do the same for each possible escape length?
