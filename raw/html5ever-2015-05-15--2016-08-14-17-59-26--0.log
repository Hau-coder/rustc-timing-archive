    [MIR] Add Storage{Live,Dead} statements to emit llvm.lifetime.{start,end}.
    
    Storage live ranges are tracked for all MIR variables and temporaries with a drop scope.
    `StorageLive` is lowered to `llvm.lifetime.start` and `StorageDead` to `llvm.lifetime.end`.
    
    There are some improvements possible here, such as:
    * pack multiple storage liveness statements by using the index of first local + `u64` bitset
    * enforce that locals are not directly accessed outside their storage live range
    * shrink storage live ranges for never-borrowed locals to initialization -> last use
    * emit storage liveness statements for *all* temporaries
     * however, the remaining ones are *always* SSA immediates, so they'd be noop in MIR trans
     * could have a flag on the temporary that its storage is irrelevant (a la C's old `register`)
       * would also deny borrows if necessary
        * this seems like an overcompliation and with packing & optimizations it may be pointless
    
    Even in the current state, it helps stage2 `rustc` compile `boiler` without overflowing (see #35408).
    
    A later addition fixes #26764 and closes #27372 by emitting `.section` directives for dylib metadata to avoid them being allocated into memory or read as `.note`. For this PR, those bugs were tripping valgrind.
