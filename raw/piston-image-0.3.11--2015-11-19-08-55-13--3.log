    Auto merge of #29932 - steveklabnik:trpl_book, r=brson
    
    The book was located under 'src/doc/trpl' because originally, it was
    going to be hosted under that URL. Late in the game, before 1.0, we
    decided that /book was a better one, so we changed the output, but
    not the input. This causes confusion for no good reason. So we'll change
    the source directory to look like the output directory, like for every
    other thing in src/doc.
