    Auto merge of #28242 - Diggsey:msvc-backtrace, r=alexcrichton
    
    Currently LLVM does not generate the debug info required to get complete backtraces even when functions are inlined, so that part of the `run-pass/backtrace-debuginfo.rs` test is disabled when targetting MSVC. At worst this results in missing stack frames where functions have been inlined.
