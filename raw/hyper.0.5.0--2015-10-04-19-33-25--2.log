    Auto merge of #28573 - ruud-v-a:rustdoc-license, r=brson
    
    The output of rustdoc includes resources licensed under the SIL Open
    Font License, the MIT license, and the Apache License 2.0. All of these
    licenses permit redistribution provided that the license text is also
    redistributed. Previously this was not the case, making rustdoc output
    unsuitable for distribution by default. This resolves that problem by
    including the license texts in rustdoc output.
