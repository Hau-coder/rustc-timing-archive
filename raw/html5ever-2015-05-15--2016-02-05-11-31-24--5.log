    You can `#[derive(FromPrimitive)]`, but it [fails later in the compile](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=82cb8ad2fac49e3fe472&version=stable) due to hardcoding `std::num::FromPrimitive` which [was removed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/eeb94886adccb3f13003f92f117115d17846ce1f) (for some reason Github doesn't show `FromPrimitive` in the diff, but `git show` does).
    
    Anyway, this PR removes the code. I didn't mark it as a breaking change, even though [this extremely contrived code using highly unstable features](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1e1b1bbff962837b228a&version=nightly) is broken by it -- should I?
