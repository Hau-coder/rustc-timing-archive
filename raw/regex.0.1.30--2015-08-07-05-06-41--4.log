    Auto merge of #27551 - arielb1:adt-def, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This ended up being a bigger refactoring than I thought, as I also cleaned a few ugly points in rustc. There are still a few areas that need improvements.
    
    Performance numbers:
    ```
    Before:
    572.70user 5.52system 7:33.21elapsed 127%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 1173368maxresident)k
    llvm-time: 385.858
    
    After:
    545.27user 5.49system 7:10.22elapsed 128%CPU (0avgtext+0avgdata 1145348maxresident)k
    llvm-time: 387.119
    ```
    
    A good 5% perf improvement. Note that after this patch >70% of the time is spent in LLVM - Amdahl's law is in full effect.
    
    Passes make check locally.
