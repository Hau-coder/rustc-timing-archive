    Alter E0412 help message wording
    
    The initial wording does not make sense due to an extra 'to'.
    
    There are two potential candidates we can change this to:
     - 'you can import it into scope'
     - 'to import it into scope'
    
    In keeping the changes minimal, we choose the first, as this is more in line with the grammar of the extended candidates help message.
