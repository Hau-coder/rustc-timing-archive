    Auto merge of #28746 - aidanhs:aphs-musl-linking-no-cxxabi, r=alexcrichton
    
    On reading https://github.com/alexcrichton/port-of-rust/blob/master/musl/Dockerfile I was surprised to see no libcxxabi. I experimented, and it does seem to be unnecessary.
    
    I guess it's a remnant from the 3.6 build.
