    Auto merge of #29229 - SingingTree:reflect_28260_in_readme, r=alexcrichton
    
    This PR adds a note to the end of the Windows build instructions to reflect the issues detailed in #28260, as well as a work around using older versions of gcc. I've avoided going into detail as I did not wish to bloat the README, and so that the changes are easy to yank once the issue is resolved.
