    Auto merge of #30651 - nagisa:mir-fix-equality-checks, r=eddyb
    
    This is not a fix to checks themselves per se (though we still use `Eq` MIR test instead of calling `PartialEq::eq`), but rather how we handle items we encounter in pattern position.
    
    Previously we would just call `PartialEq` with the constant and the matchee, but now we essentially inline the constant instead. E.g. these two snippets are functionally equivalent at MIR level:
    
    ```
    match val { Some(42) => true, _ => false }
    ```
    and
    ```
    const SECRET: Option<u8> = Some(42);
    match val { SECRET => true, _ => false }
    ```
    
    This approach also allows for more optimizations of matches. I.e. It can now exploit `SwitchInt` to switch on number inside a `Some` regardless of whether the value being an item or not.
    
    This is based on @tsionâ€™s already approved PR so I could reuse the file for more tests.
