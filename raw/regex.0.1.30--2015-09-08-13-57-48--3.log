    Auto merge of #28173 - alexcrichton:llvm-37, r=brson
    
    This updates the jemalloc and LLVM submodules to the recently released 4.0.0 and 3.7 versions. There's no breakage on the LLVM side of things because we had already been tracking the 3.7 release branch for awhile and no breakage was introduced, and jemalloc apparently is stable enough that nothing broke!
