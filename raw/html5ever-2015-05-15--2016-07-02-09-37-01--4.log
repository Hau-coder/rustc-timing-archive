    Auto merge of #34539 - arielb1:metadata-hash, r=alexcrichton
    
    Make the metadata lock more robust
    
    Fixes #33778 and friends.
    
    I also needed to add a metadata encoding version to rlibs, as they did not have it before. To keep it backwards-compatible, I added 4 zeroes to the start of the metadata, which are treated as an empty length field by older rustcs.
