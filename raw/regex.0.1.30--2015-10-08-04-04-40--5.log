    Auto merge of #28892 - cristicbz:default-wrapping, r=alexcrichton
    
    It's not very common to store `Wrapping` values, but I kept wrapping and unwrapping a hash value when I taking it out of a struct to do operations on it. I couldn't store the hash as `Wrapping<u64>` because I wanted to be able to `#[derive(Default)]` for the struct.
    
    At any rate, it feels to me that `Wrapping<T>` should implement pretty much everything `T` does. I left out `#[derive(Hash)]` since I'd be hard pressed to find a use case and wanted to avoid the extra generated code, but maybe I should add that too?
