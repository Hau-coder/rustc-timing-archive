    Auto merge of #28389 - aidanhs:aphs-update-musl-linking, r=steveklabnik
    
    In addition to instruction updates I
     - changed from wget to curl, because curl is a prerequisite of rust itself
     - removed `[...]` because they're missing from so many places it would just obscure the instructions if they were all put in
    
    r? @steveklabnik
rustc: ./regex-macros.0.1.30
cd regex_macros && cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
