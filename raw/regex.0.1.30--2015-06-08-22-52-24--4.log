    Auto merge of #25627 - murarth:execution-engine-fix, r=nrc
    
    * Removes `RustJITMemoryManager` from public API.
      This was really sort of an implementation detail to begin with.
    * `__morestack` is linked to C++ wrapper code and this pointer
      is used when resolving the symbol for `ExecutionEngine` code.
    * `__morestack_addr` is also resolved for `ExecutionEngine` code.
      This function is sometimes referenced in LLVM-generated code,
      but was not able to be resolved on Mac OS systems.
    * Added Windows support to `ExecutionEngine` API.
    * Added a test for basic `ExecutionEngine` functionality.
