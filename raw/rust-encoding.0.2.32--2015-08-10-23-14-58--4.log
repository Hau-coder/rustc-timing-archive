    Auto merge of #26818 - sfackler:duration-stabilization, r=aturon
    
    This commit stabilizes the `std::time` module and the `Duration` type.
    `Duration::span` remains unstable, and the `Display` implementation for
    `Duration` has been removed as it is still being reworked and all trait
    implementations for stable types are de facto stable.
    
    This is a [breaking-change] to those using `Duration`'s `Display`
    implementation.
    
    I'm opening this PR as a platform for discussion - there may be some method renaming to do as part of the stabilization process.
