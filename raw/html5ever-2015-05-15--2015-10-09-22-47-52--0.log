    Auto merge of #28932 - barosl:empty-comment, r=alexcrichton
    
    Previously, `/**/` was incorrectly regarded as a doc comment because it starts with `/**` and ends with `*/`. However, this caused an ICE because some code assumed that the length of a doc comment is at least 5. This commit adds an additional check to `is_block_doc_comment` that tests the length of the input.
    
    Fixes #28844.
