    Auto merge of #28306 - alexcrichton:less-rt, r=brson
    
    This commit does some refactoring to make almost all of the `std::rt` private.
    Specifically, the following items are no longer part of its API:
    
    * DEFAULT_ERROR_CODE
    * backtrace
    * unwind
    * args
    * at_exit
    * cleanup
    * heap (this is just alloc::heap)
    * min_stack
    * util
    
    The module is now tagged as `#[doc(hidden)]` as the only purpose it's serve is
    an entry point for the `panic!` macro via the `begin_unwind` and
    `begin_unwind_fmt` reexports.
