    Auto merge of #31931 - Luke-Nukem:master, r=steveklabnik
    
     Refinement of paragraph referenced by [this issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31927).
    
    The paragraph in question had been adjusted already, but I've made some further clarifications which should help with readability and not leave the reader any `dangling pointers`.
