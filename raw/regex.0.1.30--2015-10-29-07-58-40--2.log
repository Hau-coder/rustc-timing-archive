    Auto merge of #29188 - nikomatsakis:remove-contraction, r=pnkfelix
    
    This fixes #29048 (though I think adding better transactional support would be a better fix for that issue, but that is more difficult). It also simplifies region inference and changes the model to a pure data flow one, as discussed in [this internals thread](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rough-thoughts-on-the-impl-of-region-inference-mir-etc/2800). I am not 100% sure though if this PR is the right thing to do -- or at least maybe not at this moment, so thoughts on that would be appreciated.
