    Auto merge of #36203 - petrochenkov:uvsdot, r=nrc
    
    Replace `_, _` with `..` in patterns
    
    This is how https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/33627 looks in action.
    
    Looks especially nice in leftmost/rightmost positions `(first, ..)`/`(.., last)`.
    I haven't touched libsyntax intentionally because the feature is still unstable.
