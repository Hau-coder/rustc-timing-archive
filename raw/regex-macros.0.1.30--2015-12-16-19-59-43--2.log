    Auto merge of #30341 - pnkfelix:call-site-scope, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Ensure borrows of fn/closure params do not outlive invocations.
    
    Does this by adding a new CallSiteScope to the region (or rather code extent) hierarchy, which outlives even the ParameterScope (which in turn outlives the DestructionScope of a fn/closure's body).
    
    Fix #29793
