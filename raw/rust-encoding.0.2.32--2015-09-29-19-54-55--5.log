    Auto merge of #28702 - arielb1:metadata-versioning, r=nrc
    
    This prevents ICEs when old crates are used with a new version of
    rustc. Currently, the linking of crates compiled with different
    versions of rustc is completely unsupported.
    
    Fixes #28700
    
    r? @nrc
rustc: ./rust-encoding.0.2.32
