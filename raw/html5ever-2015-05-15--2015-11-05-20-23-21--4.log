    Auto merge of #29305 - alexcrichton:bad-getenv, r=brson
    
    As discovered in #29298, `env::set_var("", "")` will panic, but it turns out
    that it *also* deadlocks on Unix systems. This happens because if a panic
    happens while holding the environment lock, we then go try to read
    RUST_BACKTRACE, grabbing the environment lock, causing a deadlock.
    
    Specifically, the changes made here are:
    
    * The environment lock is pushed into `std::sys` instead of `std::env`. This
      also only puts it in the Unix implementation, not Windows where the functions
      are already threadsafe.
    * The `std::sys` implementation now returns `io::Result` so panics are
      explicitly at the `std::env` level.
