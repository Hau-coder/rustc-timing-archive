    Auto merge of #31470 - alexcrichton:lets-find-jemalloc, r=brson
    
    Both of these targets have jemalloc disabled unconditionally right now, so using
    `maybe_jemalloc` here isn't right. This fixes the case where a Linux compiler
    (which is itself configured to use jemalloc) attempts to cross-compile to MinGW,
    causing it to try to find an `alloc_jemalloc` crate (and failing).
