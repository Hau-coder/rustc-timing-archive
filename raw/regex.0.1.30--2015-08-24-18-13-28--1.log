    Auto merge of #27943 - arielb1:fast-region, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This increases regionck performance greatly - type-checking on
    librustc decreased from 9.1s to 8.1s. Because of Amdahl's law,
    total performance is improved only by about 1.5% (LLVM wizards,
    this is your opportunity to shine!).

    I am somewhat worried really need to find out why we have this Red Queen's
    Race going on here. Originally I suspected it may be a problem from RFC1214's
    warnings, but it seems to be an effect from other changes.
    
    However, the increase seems to be mostly in LLVM's time, so I guess
    it's the LLVM wizards' problem.
