    std: Clean out deprecated APIs
    
    This primarily removes a lot of `sync::Static*` APIs and rejiggers the
    associated implementations. While doing this it was discovered that the
    `is_poisoned` method can actually result in a data race for the Mutex/RwLock
    primitives, so the inner `Cell<bool>` was changed to an `AtomicBool` to prevent
    the associated data race. Otherwise the usage/gurantees should be the same
    they were before.
