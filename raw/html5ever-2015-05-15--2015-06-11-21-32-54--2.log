    Auto merge of #26226 - alexcrichton:fix-msvc-dist, r=brson
    
    Right now the distribution tarball for MSVC only includes the *.dll files for
    the supporting libraries, but not the corresponding *.lib files which allow
    actually linking to the dll. This means that the current MSVC nightlies cannot
    produce dynamically linked binaries as the *.lib files are not available to link
    against.
    
    This commit modifies the `LIB_GLOB` used to copy the files around to include the
    `lib` variant of the `dll`.
