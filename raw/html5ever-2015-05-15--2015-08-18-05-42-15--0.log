    Auto merge of #27869 - alexcrichton:libtest-panic, r=brson
    
    This commit removes the call to `panic!("Some tests failed")` at the end of all
    tests run when running with libtest. The panic is replaced with
    `std::process::exit` to have a nonzero error code, but this change both:
    
    1. Makes the test runner no longer print out the extraneous panic message at the
       end of a failing test run that some tests failed. (this is already summarized
       in the output of the test run).
    2. When running tests with `RUST_BACKTRACE` set it removes an extraneous
       backtrace from the output (only failing tests will have their backtraces in
       the output.
