    Auto merge of #29903 - nikomatsakis:incr-comp-ool-items, r=mw,nrc
    
    This PR moves items into a separate map stored in the krate, rather than storing them inline in the HIR. The HIR visitor is also modified to skip visiting nested items by default. The goal here is to ensure that if you get access to the HIR for one item, you don't automatically get access to a bunch of other items, for better dependency tracking.
