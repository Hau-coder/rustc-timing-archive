    Auto merge of #27856 - nikomatsakis:move-def-id-to-rustc, r=eddyb
    
    It doesn't really make sense for DefId to be in libsyntax -- it is concerned with a single crate only. It is the compiler that understands the idea of many crates. (At some point, there might be a useful intermediate point here.) This is a refactoring in support of incr. compilation, which will be adjusting the notion of a DefId to make it more durable across compilations.
    
    This will probably be a [breaking-change] for every plugin ever. You need to adjust things as follows:
    
        use rustc::middle::def_id::{DefId, LOCAL_CRATE}; // two most common definitions
        ast_util::is_local(def_id) => def_id.is_local()
        ast_util::local_def(node_id) => DefId::local(node_id)
