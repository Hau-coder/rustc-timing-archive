    Auto merge of #32466 - jooert:btree_append, r=apasel422
    
    Implement `append` for b-trees.
    
    I have finally found time to revive #26227, this time only with an `append` implementation.
    
    The algorithm implemented here is linear in the size of the two b-trees. It firsts creates
    a `MergeIter` from the two b-trees and then builds a new b-tree by pushing
    key-value pairs from the `MergeIter` into nodes at the right heights.
    
    Three functions for stealing have been added to the implementation of `Handle` as
    well as a getter for the height of a `NodeRef`.
    
    The docs have been updated with performance information about `BTreeMap::append` and
    the remark about B has been removed now that it is the same for all instances of `BTreeMap`.
