    Auto merge of #28631 - ranma42:robust-panic, r=alexcrichton
    
    This is mainly to avoid infinite recursion and make debugging more convenient in the anomalous case in which `on_panic` panics.
    I encountered such issues while changing libstd to debug/fix part of #28129.
    
    While writing this I was wondering about which functions belong to `panicking` and which to `unwind`.
    I placed them in this way mostly because of convenience, but I would strongly appreciate guidance.
