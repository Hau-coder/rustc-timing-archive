    Correct iterator adaptor Chain
    
    The iterator protocol specifies that the iteration ends with the return
    value `None` from `.next()` (or `.next_back()`) and it is unspecified
    what further calls return. The chain adaptor must account for this in
    its DoubleEndedIterator implementation.
    
    It uses three states:
    
    - Both `a` and `b` are valid
    - Only the Front iterator (`a`) is valid
    - Only the Back iterator (`b`) is valid
    
    The fourth state (neither iterator is valid) only occurs after Chain has
    returned None once, so we don't need to store this state.
    
    Fixes #26316
