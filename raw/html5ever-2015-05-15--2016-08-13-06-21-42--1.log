    [MIR] Add explicit SetDiscriminant StatementKind for deaggregating enums
    
    cc #35186
    
    To deaggregate enums, we need to be able to explicitly set the discriminant.  This PR implements a new StatementKind that does that.
    
    I think some of the places that have `panics!` now could maybe do something smarter.
