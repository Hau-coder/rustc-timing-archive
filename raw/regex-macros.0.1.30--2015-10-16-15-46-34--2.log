    Auto merge of #29014 - petrochenkov:stability, r=brson
    
    Stricter checking of stability attributes + enforcement of their invariants at compile time
    (+ removed dead file librustc_front/attr.rs)
    I intended to enforce use of `reason` for unstable items as well (it normally presents for new items), but it turned out too intrusive, many older unstable items don't have `reason`s.
    
    r? @aturon
    I'm studying how stability works and do some refactoring along the way, so it's probably not the last PR.
