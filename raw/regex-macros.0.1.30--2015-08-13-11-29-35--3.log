    Auto merge of #27625 - wthrowe:find, r=alexcrichton
    
    New enough find on Linux doesn't support "-perm +..." and suggests
    using "-perm /..." instead, but that doesn't work on Windows.
    Hopefully all platforms are happy with this expanded version.
    
    I don't have access to a Windows development system to test this, so someone needs to verify that this actually works there before merging.
    
    Closes #19981.
