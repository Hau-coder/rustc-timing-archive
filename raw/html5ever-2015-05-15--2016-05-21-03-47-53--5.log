    rustbuild: Touch up some test suites
    
    This adds in some missing test suites, primarily a few pretty suites. It also starts optimizing tests by default as the current test suite does, but also recognizes `--disable-optimize-tests`.
    
    Currently the optimization of tests isn't recognized by crate tests because Cargo doesn't support the ability to compile an unoptimized test suite against an optimized library. Perhaps a feature to add, though!
