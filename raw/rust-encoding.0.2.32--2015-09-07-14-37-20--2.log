    Auto merge of #28285 - steveklabnik:split_at_idiom, r=arielb1
    
    Generally, including everything that makes an unsafe block safe in the
    block is good style. Since the assert! is what makes this safe, it
    should go inside the block. I also added a few bits of whitespace.
    
    This is of course, a little style thing, so no worries if we don't want this patch.
