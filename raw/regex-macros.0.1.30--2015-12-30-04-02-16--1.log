    Auto merge of #30458 - fhahn:fix-warnings-tests-stdlib, r=sanxiyn
    
    This PR siliences some warnings when compiling stdlib with --test. Mostly remove some unused imports and added a few `#[allow(..)]`.
    
    I also marked some signal handling functions with `#[cfg(not(test))]`, because they are only called through `rt::lang_start`, which is also marked as  `#[cfg(not(test))]`
