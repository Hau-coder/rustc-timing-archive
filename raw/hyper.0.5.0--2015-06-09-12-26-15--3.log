    Auto merge of #25995 - alexcrichton:msvc-md, r=brson
    
    On MSVC there are two ways that the CRT can be linked, either statically or
    dynamically. Each object file produced by the compiler is compiled against
    msvcrt (a dll) or libcmt (a static library). When the linker is dealing with
    more than one object file, it requires that all object files link to the same
    CRT, or else the linker will spit out some errors.
    
    For now, compile code with `-MD` as it seems to appear more often in C libraries
    so we'll stick with the same trend.
