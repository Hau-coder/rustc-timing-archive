    Auto merge of #27129 - arthurprs:debug_atomic, r=alexcrichton
    
    I'm being constantly bitten by the lack of this implementation.
    
    I'm unsure if there's a reason to avoid these implementations though.
    
    Since we have a "lossy" implementation for both Mutex and RWLock (RWLock {{ locked }}) I don't think there's a big reason for not having a Debug implementation for the atomic types, even if the user can't specify the ordering.
