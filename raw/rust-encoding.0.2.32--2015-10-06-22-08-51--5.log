    Auto merge of #28841 - jld:const-slice-ice, r=Aatch
    
    This turned up as part of #3170.  When constructing an `undef` value to
    return in the error case, we were trying to get the element type of the
    Rust-level value being indexed instead of the underlying array; when
    indexing a slice, that's not an array and the LLVM assertion failure
    reflects this.
    
    The regression test is a lightly altered copy of `const-array-oob.rs`.
