    Auto merge of #28198 - alexcrichton:from-raw-mut, r=aturon
    
    Conventionally in C `*mut T` is a transfer of ownership where `*const T` is a
    loan, so `*mut T` is likely the more appropriate return type for these
    functions. Additionally, this more closely mirrors the APIs on `Box` for this
    sort of functionality.
