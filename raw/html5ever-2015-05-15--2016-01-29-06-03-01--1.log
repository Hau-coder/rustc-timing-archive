    Auto merge of #31144 - jseyfried:remove_import_ordering_restriction, r=nrc
    
    We no longer require `use` and `extern crate` items to precede other items in modules thanks to [RFC #385](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/385), but we still require `use` and `extern crate` items to precede statements in blocks (other items can appear anywhere in a block).
    
    I think that this is a needless distinction between imports and other items that contradicts the intent of the RFC.
