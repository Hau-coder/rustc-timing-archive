    Auto merge of #28351 - jonas-schievink:macro-bt, r=nrc
    
    The second commit in this PR will stop printing the macro definition site in backtraces, which cuts their length in half and increases readability (the definition site was only correct for local macros).
    
    The third commit will not print an invocation if the last one printed occurred at the same place (span). This will make backtraces caused by a self-recursive macro much shorter.
    
    (A possible alternative would be to capture the backtrace first, then limit it to a few frames at the start and end of the chain and print `...` inbetween. This would also work with multiple macros calling each other, which is not addressed by this PR - although the backtrace will still be halved)
    
    Example:
    ```rust
    macro_rules! m {
     ( 0 $($t:tt)* ) => ( m!($($t)*); );
     () => ( fn main() {0} );
    }
    
    m!(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0);
    ```
    
    On a semi-recent nightly, this yields:
    ```
