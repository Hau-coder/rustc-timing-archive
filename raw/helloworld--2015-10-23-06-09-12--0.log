    Auto merge of #29194 - chrisccerami:clarify-headers-in-traits-docs, r=Manishearth
    
    It's possible that there is some meaning I'm not grasping from the headers "Traits bounds for generic functions" and "Traits bounds for generic structs", but they seem to me like they could be clearer and more grammatically correct.
