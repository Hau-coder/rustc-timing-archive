    Auto merge of #26154 - pmarcelll:master, r=Gankro
    
    Various methods in both libcore/char.rs and librustc_unicode/char.rs were previously marked with #[inline], now every method is marked in char's impl blocks.
    Partially fixes #26124.
    EDIT: I'm not familiar with pull reqests (yet), apparently Github added my second commit to thit PR...
