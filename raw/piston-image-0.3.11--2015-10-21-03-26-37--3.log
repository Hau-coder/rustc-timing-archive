    Auto merge of #29055 - alexcrichton:tiers, r=steveklabnik
    
    This commit expands the "supported platforms" section of the book to include
    documentation on the tiers that Rust currently has as well as organizing all
    supported platforms into these various tiers. Infrastructure improvements over
    the next few months are likely to change the location of may of these platforms
    over, but for now this should faithfully represent what we've got today!
