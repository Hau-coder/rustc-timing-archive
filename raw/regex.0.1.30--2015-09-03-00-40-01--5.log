    ##### About the `struct` section specifically:
    I wasn't sure how you'd feel about the first instance since it was originally capitalized, happy to change it back if you think that's better.
    
    Also, I left 'tuple struct' as is since together it isn't a keyword. The first instance currently has single quotes but the others have nothing. I think that feels right.
    
    ##### Generally:
    I'm working through the book now and I'm happy to keep updating this branch with any formatting tweaks or updates I find if that's easier for you guys, otherwise I'll just create smaller PRs as I go. Just let me know.
