    Auto merge of #27992 - wthrowe:dead-main-2, r=alexcrichton
    
    * Suppresses warnings that main is unused when testing (#12327)
    * Makes `--test` work with explicit `#[start]` (#11766)
    * Fixes some cases where the normal main would not be disabled by `--test`, resulting in compilation failures.
