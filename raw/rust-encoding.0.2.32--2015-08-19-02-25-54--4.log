    Auto merge of #27875 - alexcrichton:msvc-f32-rem, r=nrc
    
    Currently `f32 % f32` will generate a link error on 32-bit MSVC because LLVM
    will lower the operation to a call to the nonexistent function `fmodf`. Work
    around in this in the backend by lowering to a call to `fmod` instead with
    necessary extension/truncation between floats/doubles.
    
    Closes #27859
