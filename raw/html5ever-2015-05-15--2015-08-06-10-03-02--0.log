    In Section 3.2, TARPL says that "standard allocators (including jemalloc, the one used by default in Rust) generally consider passing in 0 for the size of an allocation as Undefined Behaviour."
    However, the C standard and jemalloc manual says allocating zero bytes
    should succeed:
    
    - C11 7.22.3 paragraph 1: "If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation-defined: either a null pointer is returned, or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object."
    - [jemalloc manual](http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=jemalloc&sektion=3): "The malloc and calloc functions return a	pointer	to the allocated memory if successful; otherwise a NULL pointer is returned and errno is set to ENOMEM."
        + Note that the description for `allocm` says "Behavior	is undefined if	size is 0," but it is an experimental API.
