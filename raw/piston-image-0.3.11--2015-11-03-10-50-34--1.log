    Auto merge of #29529 - Ryman:rustdoc-cap-lints, r=alexcrichton
    
    This sets the `cap-lints` setting to 'allow' for all doc compilations. There's precedent for this as rustdoc [already whitelists unstable code](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/librustdoc/core.rs#L112) when compiling documentation, with the expectation being that a regular compile will complain about any problems. I think the same justification applies here.
    
    Problem case in the wild: https://github.com/laumann/compiletest-rs/pull/28
