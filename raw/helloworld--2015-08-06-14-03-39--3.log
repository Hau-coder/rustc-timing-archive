    Auto merge of #27296 - jroesch:type-macros, r=huonw
    
    This pull request implements the functionality for [RFC 873](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0873-type-macros.md). This is currently just an update of @freebroccolo's branch from January, the corresponding commits are linked in each commit message.
    
    @nikomatsakis and I had talked about updating the macro language to support a lifetime fragment specifier, and it is possible to do that work on this branch as well. If so we can (collectively) talk about it next week during the pre-RustCamp work week.
