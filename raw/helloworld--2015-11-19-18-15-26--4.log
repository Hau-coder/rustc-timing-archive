    Auto merge of #29894 - alexcrichton:stdtime, r=brson
    
    This commit is an implementation of [RFC 1288][rfc] which adds two new unstable
    types to the `std::time` module. The `Instant` type is used to represent
    measurements of a monotonically increasing clock suitable for measuring time
    withing a process for operations such as benchmarks or just the elapsed time to
    do something. An `Instant` favors panicking when bugs are found as the bugs are
    programmer errors rather than typical errors that can be encountered.
    
    [rfc]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1288
    
    The `SystemTime` type is used to represent a system timestamp and is not
    monotonic. Very few guarantees are provided about this measurement of the system
    clock, but a fixed point in time (`UNIX_EPOCH`) is provided to learn about the
    relative distance from this point for any particular time stamp.
    
    This PR takes the same implementation strategy as the `time` crate on crates.io,
    namely:
    
    |  Platform  |  Instant                 |  SystemTime              |
    |------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
    | Windows    | QueryPerformanceCounter  | GetSystemTimeAsFileTime  |
    | OSX        | mach_absolute_time       | gettimeofday             |
    | Unix       | CLOCK_MONOTONIC          | CLOCK_REALTIME           |
    
    These implementations can perhaps be refined over time, but they currently
    satisfy the requirements of the `Instant` and `SystemTime` types while also
    being portable across implementations and revisions of each platform.
