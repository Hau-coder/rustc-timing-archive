    Auto merge of #27851 - nikomatsakis:cleanup-ty-decoder, r=eddyb
    
    Just a little code cleanup I was doing as part of another refactoring (which may turn out not to be needed). The main thrust of this is to cleanup the interface to `tydecode.rs` to be less ridiculously repetitive. I also purged the generic "def-id conversion" parameter in favor of a trait object, just to reduce code duplication a bit and make the signatures a bit less messy. I measured the bootstrapping time to build stage2 with these changes, it was identical. (But it'd be easy enough to restore the unboxed closure if we wanted it.)
