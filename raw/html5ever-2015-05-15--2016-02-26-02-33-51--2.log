    Auto merge of #31857 - jseyfried:fix_scoping, r=nikomatsakis
    
    This fixes a bug (#31845) introduced in #31105 in which lexical scopes contain items from all anonymous module ancestors, even if the path to the anonymous module includes a normal module:
    ```rust
    fn f() {
        fn g() {}
        mod foo {
            fn h() {
               g(); // This erroneously resolves on nightly
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    
    This is a [breaking-change] on nightly but not on stable or beta.
