    Auto merge of #32080 - eddyb:transcendent, r=nikomatsakis
    
    Refactor call & function handling in trans, enable MIR bootstrap.
    
    Non-Rust and Rust ABIs were combined into a common codepath, which means:
    * The ugly `__rust_abi` "clown shoes" shim for C->Rust FFI is gone, fixes #10116.
    * Methods, *including virtual ones* support non-Rust ABIs, closes #30235.
    * Non-Rust ABIs also pass fat pointers in two arguments; the result should be identical.
    * Zero-sized types are never passed as arguments; again, behavior shouldn't change.
    
    Additionally, MIR support for calling intrinsics (through old trans) was implemented.
    Alongside assorted fixes, it enabled MIR to launch :rocket: and do a *complete* bootstrap.
    To try it yourself, `./configure --enable-orbit` *or* `make RUSTFLAGS="-Z orbit"`.
