    Auto merge of #28623 - llogiq:faster-fasta, r=brson
    
    I just removed the num_cpus dependency (because we don't want that in there), using 4 threads instead.
    
    I should add that Veedrac asked me to submit this here in his name.
rustc: ./regex-macros.0.1.30
cd regex_macros && cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
