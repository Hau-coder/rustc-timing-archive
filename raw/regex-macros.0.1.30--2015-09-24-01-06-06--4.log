    > 17:13 EDT < Moonlightning> I think I found a bug in the str::matches() documentation. Was it copied from str::split()? :p
    > 17:13 EDT < Moonlightning> Because it says “The pattern can be a simple `&str`, `char`, or a closure that determines the split.”
    
    I changed "determines the split" to "determines if a character matches".
    
    It's not super clear, "determines the split" is not super clear to begin with, maybe this can be made better? On the other hand following the link to Pattern provides enough details.
