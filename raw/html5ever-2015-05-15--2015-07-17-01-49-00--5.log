    Auto merge of #27066 - rust-lang:rollup_central, r=steveklabnik
    
    Everything on this branch has passed check-stage2 on linux.
    
    This is a temporary integration branch until [our buildbot problems](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/buildbot-is-down-for-a-bit/2365/3) get fixed.
    As the day progresses I'll merge more PRs into this branch once I get them through make check.
    
    This branch isn't complete, keeping it up here so more people can merge PRs into integration if they want.
