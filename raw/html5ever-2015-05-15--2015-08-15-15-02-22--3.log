    Auto merge of #27845 - dylanmckay:abstract-pointer-size-away, r=alexcrichton
    
    This patch rewrites code in several places which assume that the current target has either 32-bit or 64-bit pointers so that it can support arbitrary-width pointers.
    
    It does not completely remove all assumptions of pointer width, but it does reduce them significantly. There is a discussion [here](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/adding-16-bit-pointer-support/2484/10) about the change.
