    Auto merge of #27153 - alexcrichton:flaky-tests, r=brson
    
    This commit ensures that the rustc thread does not leak a panic message whenever
    a call to `fatal` happens. This already happens for the main rustc thread as
    part of the `rustc_driver::monitor` function, but the compiler also spawns
    threads for other operations like `-C codegen-units`, and sometimes errors are
    emitted on these threads as well. To ensure that there's a consistent
    error-handling experience across threads this unifies these two to never print
    the panic message in the case of a normal and expected fatal error.
    
    This should also fix the flaky `asm-src-loc-codegen-units.rs` test as the output
    is sometimes garbled if diagnostics are printed while the panic message is also
    being printed.
