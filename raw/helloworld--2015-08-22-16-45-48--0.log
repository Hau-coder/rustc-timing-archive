    Auto merge of #27914 - pnkfelix:fix-fcnr-for-valgrind, r=alexcrichton
    
    Fix (and extend) src/test/run-pass/foreign-call-no-runtime.rs
    
    While going over various problems signaled by valgrind when running `make check` on a build configured with `--enable-valgrind`, I discovered a bug in this test case.
    
    Namely, the test case was previously creating an `i32` (originally an `int` aka `isize` but then we changed the name and the fallback rules), and then reading from a `*const isize`. Valgrind rightly complains about this, since we are reading an 8 byte value on 64-bit systems, but in principle only 4 bytes have been initialized.
    
    (I wish this was the only valgrind unclean test, but unfortunately there are a bunch more. This was just the easiest/first one that I dissected.)
