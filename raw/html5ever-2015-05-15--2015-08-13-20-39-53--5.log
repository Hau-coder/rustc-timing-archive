    Auto merge of #27696 - bluss:into-boxed-str, r=alexcrichton
    
    Rename String::into_boxed_slice -> into_boxed_str
    
    This is the name that was decided in rust-lang/rfcs#1152, and it's
    better if we say “boxed str” for `Box<str>`.
    
    The old name `String::into_boxed_slice` is deprecated.
