    Auto merge of #31312 - alexcrichton:no-le-in-powerpc64le, r=alexcrichton
    
    Currently the `mipsel-unknown-linux-gnu` target doesn't actually set the
    `target_arch` value to `mipsel` but it rather uses `mips`. Alternatively the
    `powerpc64le` target does indeed set the `target_arch` as `powerpc64le`,
    causing a bit of inconsistency between theset two.
    
    As these are just the same instance of one instruction set, let's use
    `target_endian` to switch between them and only set the `target_arch` as one
    value. This should cut down on the number of `#[cfg]` annotations necessary and
    all around be a little more ergonomic.
