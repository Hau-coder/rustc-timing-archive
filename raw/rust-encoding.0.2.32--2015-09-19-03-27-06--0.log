    Auto merge of #28491 - dotdash:noadjust, r=nikomatsakis
    
    That allows us to keep using trans_into() in case of adjustments that
    may actually be ignored in trans because they are a plain deref/ref pair
    with no overloaded deref or unsizing.
    
    Unoptimized(!) benchmarks from servo/servo#7638
