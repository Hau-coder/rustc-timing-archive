    Auto merge of #27980 - tbu-:pr_cloexec_dup, r=alexcrichton
    
    Still needs values of F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC on other OSs.
    
    For Bitrig, NetBSD and OpenBSD the constant was incorrectly in posix01, when
    it's actually posix08. In order to maintain backwards-compatiblity, the
    constant was only copied, not moved.
