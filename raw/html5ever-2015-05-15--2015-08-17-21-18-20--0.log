    Auto merge of #27169 - huonw:simd, r=alexcrichton
    
    This implements https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1199 (except for doing all the platform intrinsics).
    
    Things remaining for SIMD (not necessarily in this PR):
    
    - [x] I (@huonw) am signed up to ensure the compiler matches the RFC, when it lands
    - [x] the platform specific intrinsics aren't properly type checked at the moment (LLVM will throw a "random" assertion)
    - [ ] there's a lot of useful intrinsics that are missing, including whole platforms (mips, powerpc)
    - [ ] the target-feature `cfg` detection/adding is not so great at the moment
    - [x] I think the platform specific intrinsics should go in their own `extern` ABI (i.e. not `"rust-intrinsic"`)
    
    (I'm adjusting the RFC to reflect the latter.)
    
    I think it would be very nice for this to land without requiring the RFC to land first, because of the first point, and because this is the only way for any further work to happen/be experimented with, without requiring people to build/install/multirust a compiler from a custom branch.
