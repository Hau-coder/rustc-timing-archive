    Auto merge of #26385 - nham:fix_25396, r=alexcrichton
    
    Currently in the E0252 message, traits and modules are all called types (as in "a type named `Foo` has already been imported", even when `Foo` was a trait or module). This commit changes that to additionally detect when the import in question is a trait or module and report it accordingly.
    
    Fixes #25396.
