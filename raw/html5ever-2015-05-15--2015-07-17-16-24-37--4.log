    Auto merge of #27045 - nikomatsakis:better-object-defaults-error, r=pnkfelix
    
    Transition to the new object lifetime defaults, replacing the old defaults completely.
    
    r? @pnkfelix
    
    This is a [breaking-change] as specified by [RFC 1156][1156] (though all cases that would break should have been receiving warnings starting in Rust 1.2). Types like `&'a Box<Trait>` (or `&'a Rc<Trait>`, etc) will change from being interpreted as `&'a Box<Trait+'a>` to `&'a Box<Trait+'static>`. To restore the old behavior, write the `+'a` explicitly. For example, the function:
    
    
    ```rust
    trait Trait { }
    fn foo(x: &Box<Trait>) { ... }
    ```
    
    would be rewritten as:
    
    ```rust
    trait Trait { }
    fn foo(x: &'a Box<Trait+'a>) { ... }
    ```
    
    if one wanted to preserve the current typing.
