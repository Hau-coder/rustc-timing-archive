    Auto merge of #27197 - nwin:generic-cursor-impl, r=alexcrichton
    
    This is a revival of #23364. Github didnâ€™t recognize my updated branch there.
    
    The cursor implementation now uses `AsRef` which means that fixed-sized array can now be used with `Cursor`. Besides that, the generic implementation simplifies the code as the macro can be avoided.
    
    The only drawback is, that specialized implementation for fixed-sized arrays are now ruled out unless [RFC#1210](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1210) is accepted & implemented.
    
    `Box<[u8]>` cannot be used yet, but that should be mitigated by [implementing `AsRef` for `Box` and friends](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/forward-implement-traits-on-smart-pointers-make-smart-pointers-more-transparent/2380/3). I will submit a separate PR for that later as it is an orthogonal issue.
