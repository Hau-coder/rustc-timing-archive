    Auto merge of #30763 - gchp:issue/30033, r=nagisa
    
    This is achieved by adding the scan_back method. This method looks back
    through the source_text of the StringReader until it finds the target
    char, returning it's offset in the source. We use this method to find
    the offset of the opening single quote, and use that offset as the start
    of the error.
    
    Given this code:
    
    ```rust
    fn main() {
        let _ = 'abcd';
    }
    ```
    
    The compiler would give a message like:
    
    ```
    error: character literal may only contain one codepoint: ';
    let _ = 'abcd';
                 ^~
    ```
    With this change, the message now displays:
    
    ```
    error: character literal may only contain one codepoint: 'abcd';
    let _ = 'abcd';
            ^~~~~~~
    ```
    
    Fixes #30033
