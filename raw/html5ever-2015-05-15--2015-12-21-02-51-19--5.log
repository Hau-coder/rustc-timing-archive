    Auto merge of #30413 - pnkfelix:fsk-span_note, r=Manishearth
    
    Add note when item accessed from module via `m.i` rather than `m::i`.
    
    (I tried to make this somewhat future-proofed, in that the `UnresolvedNameContext` could be expanded in the future with other cases besides paths that are known to be modules.)
    
    This supersedes PR #30356 ; since I'm responsible for a bunch of new code here, someone else should review it. :)
