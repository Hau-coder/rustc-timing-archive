    Auto merge of #29897 - alexcrichton:process-wait-with-output, r=brson
    
    Previously this function used channels but this isn't necessary any more now
    that threads have return values. This also has the added bonus of appropriately
    waiting for the thread to exit to ensure that the function doesn't still have
    running threads once it returns.
