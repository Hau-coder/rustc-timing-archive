    Auto merge of #28603 - steveklabnik:small_config_fix, r=alexcrichton
    
    We don't actually probe for javac in all circumstances, so if you have
    javac installed, but don't have antlr4 installed, and you're on Mac OS
    X, then you'll get a message that javac is missing, even though that's
    wrong.
    
    To fix this, let's just be a bit more generic in the message, so that
    it's the same no matter what part of the lexer tests you're missing.
