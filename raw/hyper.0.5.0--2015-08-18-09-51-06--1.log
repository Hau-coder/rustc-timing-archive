    Auto merge of #27880 - remram44:doc-seek-repetitions, r=steveklabnik
    
    "Don't seek past end of stream" is mentioned twice in a row. This happened because seeking before offset 0 was previously mentioned there, and was moved to the "errors" section afterwards.
    
    Somehow made it through [#26924](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/26924/files#diff-668f8f358d4a93474b396dcb3727399eR825).
