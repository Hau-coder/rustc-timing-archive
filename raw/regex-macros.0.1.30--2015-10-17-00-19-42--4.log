    Auto merge of #29079 - fhahn:remove-unused-files-libcoretest, r=alexcrichton
    
    While working on #28711 I found out that
    
    *  src/libcoretest/clone.rs
    * src/libcoretest/fmt/float.rs
    * src/libcoretest/intrinsics.rs
    
    are not used. I am not sure if removing them is the right way to go. If it makes sense to keep (and fix and enable) them, I would be happy to update the PR.
