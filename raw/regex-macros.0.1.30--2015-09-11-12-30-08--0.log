    When the inliner has to decided if it wants to inline a function A into an
    internal function B, it first checks whether it would be more profitable
    to inline B into its callees instead. This means that it has to analyze
    B, which involves checking the assumption cache. Building the assumption
    cache requires scanning the whole function, and because inlining
    currently clears the assumption cache, this scan happens again and
    again, getting even slower as the function grows from inlining.
    
    As inlining the huge find functions isn't really useful anyway, we can
    mark them as noinline, which skips the cost analysis and reduces compile
    times by as much as 70%.
