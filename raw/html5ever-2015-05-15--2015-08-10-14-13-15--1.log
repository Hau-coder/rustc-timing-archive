    Auto merge of #27252 - tbu-:pr_less_transmutes, r=alexcrichton
    
    The replacements are functions that usually use a single `mem::transmute` in their body and restrict input and output via more concrete types than `T` and `U`. Worth noting are the `transmute` functions for slices and the `from_utf8*` family for mutable slices. Additionally, `mem::transmute` was often used for casting raw pointers, when you can already cast raw pointers just fine with `as`.
    
    This builds upon #27233.
