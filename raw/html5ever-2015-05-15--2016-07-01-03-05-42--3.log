    rustbuild: Clean out tmp directory on `make clean`
    
    Right now we generate error index information into this directory, but it's
    never cleaned out. This means that if a build *bounces* because of something in
    this directory it'll continue to cause all future builds to fail because the
    relevant files are never removed.
