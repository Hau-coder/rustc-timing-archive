    Auto merge of #28038 - durka:grep-unstable-issue-refs, r=alexcrichton
    
    After submitting #28031, I ran a [script](https://gist.github.com/durka/a5243440697c780f669b) on the rest of src/ and found some anomalies. In this PR are the fixes that I thought were obvious (but I might be wrong!). The others I've submitted in issue #28037.
