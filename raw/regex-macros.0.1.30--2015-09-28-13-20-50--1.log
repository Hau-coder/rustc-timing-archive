    Auto merge of #28668 - alexcrichton:crossing-with-jemalloc, r=nrc
    
    This commit updates the compiler to not attempt to use jemalloc for platforms
    where jemalloc is never enabled. Currently the compiler attempts to link in
    jemalloc based on whether `--disable-jemalloc` was specified at build time for
    the compiler itself, but this is only the right decision for the host target,
    not for other targets.
    
    This still leaves a hole open where a set of target libraries are downloaded
    which were built with `--disable-jemalloc` and the compiler is unaware of that,
    but this is a pretty rare case so it can always be fixed later.
