    Auto merge of #34155 - ollie27:unzip, r=alexcrichton
    
    Remove unzip() SizeHint hack
    
    This was using an invalid iterator so is likely to end with buggy
    behaviour.
    
    It also doesn't even benefit many type in std including Vec so removing it
    shouldn't cause any problems.
    
    Fixes: #33468
