    Auto merge of #28938 - GlenDC:master, r=Manishearth
    
    Here is my attempt to resolve issue #28822, @Manishearth.
    Please let me know if it's fine. And if not, what should I do instead?
    
    This issue felt like quite a good start for some rust contributions. It allows me to get used to the workflow  and codebase of rust in an easy-to-swallow manner. Are there any other issues you would recommend me to look at? :) Would love to do some more stuff!
