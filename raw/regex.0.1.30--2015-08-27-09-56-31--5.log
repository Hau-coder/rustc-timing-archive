    Auto merge of #28016 - ranma42:mini-rem-in-core, r=alexcrichton
    
    The implementation of the remainder operation belongs to
    librustc_trans, but it is also stubbed out in libcore in order to
    expose it as a trait on primitive types. Instead of exposing some
    implementation details (like the upcast to `f64` in MSVC), use a
    minimal implementation just like that of the `Div` trait.
