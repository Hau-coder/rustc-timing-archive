    The reason this was not failing is fascinating.  The variable $(rustc)
    is empty, so the make recipe was expanded as " -o foo foo.rs".  make
    interpreted this as an instruction to run the command "o foo foo.rs"
    and ignore any failure that occurred, because it uses a leading '-' on
    a command to signal that behavior.
rustc: ./rust-encoding.0.2.32
cargo rustc -- -Ztime-passes
makefile:2: recipe for target 'all' failed
done
