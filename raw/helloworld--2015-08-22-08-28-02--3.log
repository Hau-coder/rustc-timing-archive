    Auto merge of #27892 - nikomatsakis:issue-27583, r=pnkfelix
    
    Issue #27583 was caused by the fact that `LUB('a,'b)` yielded `'static`, even if there existed a region `'tcx:'a+'b`. This PR replaces the old very hacky code for computing how free regions relate to one another with something rather more robust. This solves the issue for #27583, though I think that similar bizarro bugs can no doubt arise in other ways -- the root of the problem is that the region-inference code was written in an era when a LUB always existed, but that hasn't held for some time. To *truly* solve this problem, it needs to be generalized to cope with that reality. But let's leave that battle for another day.
