    Auto merge of #29456 - alexcrichton:path-hash, r=aturon
    
    Almost all operations on Path are based on the components iterator in one form
    or another to handle equivalent paths. The `Hash` implementations, however,
    mistakenly just went straight to the underlying `OsStr`, causing these
    equivalent paths to not get merged together.
    
    This commit updates the `Hash` implementation to also be based on the iterator
    which should ensure that if two paths are equal they hash to the same thing.
