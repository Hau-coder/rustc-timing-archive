    Auto merge of #30221 - thyrgle:concurrency_doc, r=alexcrichton
    
    The example code in the Channels subsection of the rust book give warnings about
    
        unused result which must be used, #[warn(unused_must_use)] on by default
    
    Added a small pattern match to resolve those warnings.
