    Auto merge of #29963 - dotdash:fat_copy, r=eddyb
    
    Since fat pointers do not qualify as structural types, they got copied
    using load_ty and store_ty, which means that we load an FCA and use
    extractvalue to get the components of the fat pointer. This breaks
    certain optimizations in LLVM.
