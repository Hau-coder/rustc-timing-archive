    Auto merge of #26160 - alexcrichton:revert-rc-as-ref, r=aturon
    
    This is a revert of PR #26008 which caused the unintended breakage reported in #26096. We may want to add these implementations in the long run, but for now this revert allows us to take some more time to evaluate the impact of such a change (e.g. run it through crater).
    
    Closes #26096
