    Auto merge of #27962 - dotdash:overflow, r=alexcrichton
    
    We're currently possibly introducing an unneeded temporary, make use of
    InsertValue which is said to kick us off of FastISel and we generate
    loads/stores of first class aggregates, which is bad as well. Let's not
    do all these things.
